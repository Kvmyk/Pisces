# Pisces Programming Language Technical Info
Pisces is a stack-based programming language with a custom compiler written entirely in Python. Designed with simplicity and educational value in mind, Pisces offers a unique blend of features, making it an excellent choice for understanding low-level programming concepts.

## Stack Architecture
Emphasizes a stack-based operational paradigm, allowing intuitive manipulation of data and operations.
## Python-Powered Compiler
The compiler, crafted in Python, translates Pisces programs into x86-64 assembly, enabling seamless execution on modern systems.
## Assembly Integration
Converts .psc code into assembler files with support for common operations like arithmetic, conditional jumps, and I/O handling.
## Runtime Efficiency
Includes mechanisms for precise runtime measurement and execution profiling.
## Educational Focus
Simplified syntax and clear operational flow make it an excellent tool for teaching compiler design and assembly language basics.

### Pisces not only serves as a functional programming language but also as a platform for exploring language design, assembly-level operations, and compiler implementation.
